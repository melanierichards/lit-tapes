### Music in this book

Nearly all of the songs mentioned in “All My Rage” are courtesy of one of the main characters, a teenaged girl named Noor. No matter what chaos is unfolding around her, Noor processes her life largely through the sound coming through her headphones. That’s something I appreciate about this book—it’s a love letter to music, without the plot being _driven_ by music.

Noor’s mix is eclectic. There’s a heavy emphasis on Dad rock, interpersed with Pakistani tracks, rap beats, and alternative music. The opening track, “The Wanderer” is woven throughout the story.
