## Music in this book

Our protagonist, Meche, and her friends discover that they can play vinyl albums to cast spells; as teens without command over the chaos in their lives, they spin records to exert some sense of control. Music is how Meche connects to her father, how she processes emotions—overall, music is the power that drives Meche’s life forward.

Aside: the way Meche uses her Walkman as a security blanket makes me pine for my iPod (RIP).
