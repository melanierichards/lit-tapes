## Music in this book

“Daisy Jones & The Six” is an interview-format fiction about a band that explodes in popularity during the 1970s, then falls apart. There are actually not too many references to real songs in this book, and these are mostly covered early on—usually as something Daisy would sing idlly.

The book does reference quite a few real-world artists, but these are mostly to contextualize the fictional band in their sonic era, before moving on to the heart of the story.
