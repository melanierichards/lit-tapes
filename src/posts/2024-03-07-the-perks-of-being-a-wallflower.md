## Music in this book

Most of the songs referenced in this book appear on a mix tape that Charlie (the protagonist) makes for his friend, Patrick, as a Secret Santa gift. The songs themselves are a mix of:

* Songs that Charlie, Patrick, and Sam (Patrick’s sister) listened to together
* Wintry songs
* Songs from a mix tape a boy gave to Charlie’s sister

In that last category, the song “Asleep” by The Smiths comes up again and again in this epistolary novel.
