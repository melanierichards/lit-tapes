## Music in this book

Samantha Irby’s essays are rife with pop culture references; she uses music to contextualize or add texture to a personal story. This book’s playlist is further bolstered by the essay “Late-1900s Time Capsule”, which is essentially one long, annotated playlist and an ode to the 1990s.
